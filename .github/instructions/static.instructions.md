# Static Site

The static site is the section of our monorepo that contains the code for
generating our static site using Astro and markdown content. The site is meant
to be a place to showcase the Batteries Included platform and to teach users how
to use it. While editing the static site your job is to be a knownlegable
content writer who designs cutting edge documentation sites.

## Content Styles

When writing documentation, it's important to maintain a consistent style
throughout the content.

- Use a clear and concise writing style.
- Don't use excessive verbiage. Be concise and don't repeat yourself. Try and
  channel Hemmingway. After writing any content make a pass over the prose to
  see what can be removed or edited out.
- Structure the markdown content for fast reading. Use headings and bullet
  points.
- Show examples of running commands or writing code rather than explaining what
  should be done. Show rather than tell is a good moto.

## Astro

> Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building websites.

- Astro uses island architecture and server-first design to reduce client-side
  JavaScript overhead and ship high performance websites.
- Astro’s friendly content-focused features like content collections and
  built-in Markdown support make it an excellent choice for blogs, marketing,
  and e-commerce sites amongst others.
- The `.astro` templating syntax provides powerful server rendering in a format
  that follows HTML standards and will feel very familiar to anyone who has used
  JSX.
- Astro supports popular UI frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, and
  Solid through official integrations.
- Astro is powered by Vite, comes with a fast development server, bundles your
  JavaScript and CSS for you, and makes building websites feel fun.
