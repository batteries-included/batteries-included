## Pre-Configured Local Installation

For fast local development or testing, you can use our pre-configured
installations. This script sets up a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind,
installs all necessary components, and configures everything for you. To use
that pre-configured local installation, simply run the following command in your
terminal:

<div align="center" class="mb-8">
  <ScriptDisplay
    src="https://home.batteriesincl.com/api/v1/scripts/start_local"
    class="max-w-5xl mx-auto"
  />
</div>

From then on the `bi` binary will be located at `~/.local/bin/bi` so starting a
new Kubernetes cluster is just one command away:

```bash
bi start-local
```

## Design Your Installation

If instead you want to design your installation, choosing what software, and
where to run it, then start by logging in or creating an account at
[https://home.batteriesincl.com/login](https://home.batteriesincl.com/login).
Once logged in, click `Create an installation` and provide some basic details
for your environment.

Then, choose your preferred deployment type:

- **Local Development**: Perfect for testing locally using Kind (requires
  Docker).
- **Cloud Deployment**: Seamless automated setup on AWS with EKS.
- **Existing Cluster**: Simple installation on your current Kubernetes
  infrastructure, whether it's running on AWS, Azure, or any other cloud
  provider.

### Run Installation

After configuring your installation details, you'll receive a simple one-line
shell script. Just copy and run this command - we'll take care of all the
configuration, security, and integration automatically!

## Post-Installation

That's it! Once installation completes, the control server becomes your central
hub for:

### Battery Management

Choose from our wide arsenal of batteries to include in your installation:

- **Databases**: Deploy and manage PostgreSQL, FerretDB/MongoDB, and Redis
  instances.
- **Monitoring**: Set up VictoriaMetrics with Grafana dashboards.
- **Web Services**: Deploy with Knative for automatic serverless scaling.
- **AI/ML**: Add Jupyter notebooks, vector databases, and LLMs (Ollama).
- **Security**: Configure OAuth and SSO with Keycloak, SSL certificates, mTLS,
  and more.

### Project Management

Build and manage your infrastructure through our intuitive project system:

- Choose specialized project templates for Web, AI/ML, Database, or custom
  needs.
- Access monitoring, logging, and management through a unified dashboard.

### System Overview

Monitor and manage your entire infrastructure from one place:

- Monitor resource usage across your cluster(s).
- Check service health and status.
- Access centralized logging.
- Manage configurations and settings.
- View performance metrics and alerts.
