Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for data science, machine
learning, and general programming. With Batteries Included, you can quickly set
up notebooks with pre-configured environments for Python, R, Julia, etc.

## Installing Jupyter Notebooks

To get started with Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Navigate to the `AI` section in the control server.
2. Click `Manage Batteries`.
3. Find the `Notebooks` battery and click `Install`.

## Environment Variables

You can connect your notebook to other services by adding environment variables:

- Add database connections (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`)
- Configure API keys
- Set other environment-specific variables

These variables will be available in your notebook's environment automatically.
