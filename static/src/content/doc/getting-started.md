# Getting Started with Batteries Included

Whether you're building web services, running AI workloads, or managing
databases, getting started takes just a few minutes:

1. **Choose Where to Run**: Deploy locally for development or to your preferred
   cloud environment.
2. **Tell Us What You Need**: Select the components you want to run - databases,
   web services, AI tools, monitoring, etc.

That's it! After setup completes, you'll have access to the control server where
you can:
