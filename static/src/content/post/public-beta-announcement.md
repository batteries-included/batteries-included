# The automated DevOps platform built to help teams reduce site reliability overheadd

**[Now in public beta](https://home.batteriesincl.com/signup): Batteries
Included automated DevOps platform to leverage the power of open source
platforms**

For the modern web and full stack developer, it can feel like an impossible feat
to spin up and manage your DevOps infrastructure. Where to begin, which
technologies to leverage, and how to ramp expertise across the required open
source platform ecosystem for cloud native development.

In fast growing and agile organizations, resourcing for both time and subject
matter experts is limited. With today's technology and tooling, there's no
reason we can't have a 'one click' infrastructure deployment with the most
powerful open source technologies behind it.

After spending my career building platforms to deliver on platform engineering
strategy, development experience, and ML-powered distributed systems all powered
by open source - it was clear that product engineering teams were stuck in the
DevOps weeds when they should be focused on building great products.

This is the core reason
[why we built Batteries Included](https://www.batteriesincl.com/posts/vision)
and I'm excited to announce we're in
[public](https://www.batteriesincl.com/posts/fairsource) beta with a fully
featured line of batteries to support your team's infrastructure needs.

Batteries Included is a powerful devops platform built to enable teams to deploy
infrastructure and monitoring in minutes vs months. Built on open source
technologies and we're also committed to sharing our source code as an open
source platform

## Batteries to deploy, monitor, scale, and focus on your products, not infrastructure

With Batteries, engineering teams can:

- Spin up the
  [best in class Postgres database](https://www.batteriesincl.com/solutions/database)
  in seconds with integrations for pgvector or PostGIS
- Deploy and scale
  [serverless web services](https://www.batteriesincl.com/solutions/web-deploy)
  with blue/green deployment system and automated scaling
- Deliver AI experiences with the power of your
  [own RAG stack and LLM modeling](https://www.batteriesincl.com/solutions/ai)

This includes powerful features like a cohesive SSO solution that lets you
deploy SSL and OAuth to all products, and an operational command center with out
of the box monitoring powered by Grafana and Victoria Metrics.

## Harness the power of the most innovative oss platforms

Adopting Open source can be a huge commitment for an agile team. You need to
hire the right talent or ramp up expertise across multiple domains. Batteries
Included gives you the tools to access these incredible platforms with no
experience necessary in an accessible UI.

With Batteries Included, developers are able to tap the full functionality of
these platforms including:

- Database driven Kubernetes self-hosted on the private or public cloud of your
  choice; or scale down to local Kind
- SSO and SSL auto-configured for Keycloak, Istio Ingress, Oauth Proxy
- PGVector for a ector database to host your AI projects with text embedding
  models via Ollama
- Experiment/Test your AI projects with JupyterLabs notebooks

Batteries Included is
[committed to open source](https://www.batteriesincl.com/posts/open-source-payoff)
both making it accessible, sustainable, and effective for businesses and
contributing to OSS projects.

**Now in public beta for free - for a limited time**

Batteries Included is now in public beta which also means it's currently 100%
free to use for our early adopters. The source code will always be available,
but currently all usage is free to celebrate.
