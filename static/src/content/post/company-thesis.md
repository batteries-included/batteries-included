There's a growing need for an integrated software platform that encompasses all
components of a modern tech stack -â€” pre-configured, optimized, and managed
hands-off. While well-constructed infrastructure can be a force multiplier for
businesses, it also requires numerous moving pieces to integrate smoothly,
stably, and scalably. This is neither easy nor cheap to achieve.

Companies want to pay to have their undifferentiated infrastructure problems
wholly solved, and an all-inclusive upscale solution would command a good price
while standing out in the market. Batteries Included aims to provide this
integrated collaborative platform, coupled with automated operations at scale
and experienced teams for specialized work. Our goal is to offer a total package
that surpasses much of what the cloud and traditional infrastructure teams can
provide.

## Any Company's Infrastructure Team

Anecdotally, all tech companies end up with an infrastructure team, whether
formally designated or self-appointed. Modern businesses always seem to need
lots of the same software, including databases, networking, email, server
health, file storage, web servers, etc. This lower-level stack continues to grow
more and more complex, with each level building on the hard-won knowledge of
engineers, who love the details of bytes, IOPS, hertz, and PPS.

However, these backend systems, while critical, often don't directly drive
business value. Most companies need a database, but few generate extra revenue
because they have a marginally better database. The same applies to much of the
critical software infrastructure.

Since businesses keep creating the infrastructure team, it has to be instructive
of what they really want. These teams are all building a platform to tie all the
systems together, then giving that platform to the product-focused or
business-focused parts of the company.

How many startup companies around the world are burning VC capital building a
login page for ML notebooks? Or a listing page for database backups? Lots and
lots of duplicated work that has to be maintained, or worse, break production.
These small teams don't have the resources to dedicate and love every part of
the platform.

## Tech Leaders

World-class tech companies are investing heavily in their internal tools
platforms. It's their superpower that's used to move into new markets quickly
and turn around struggling acquisitions. Starting the next photo-sharing app at
a FAANG is easier because the complex parts are simply an arms reach away. Need
scalable storage? Yep, it's over there. Need fast, easy ML? Yep, easy to build
models right this way? Build service, hosting, monitoring... Yep all done
already.

## Not Hotdog

This superpower directly impacts the startup world all the time. Take the famous
hypothetical app [Not Hotdog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs) the
following sequence is so believable. It seems trite:

- Not Hotdog launches and sees some mild success
- The app continues to trend upwards until it gets an unexpected boost.
- The unexpected traffic starts

- The startup has to dedicate focus and resources to their internal
  infrastructure. While small competitor spends this time, the major companies
  have started their own competitor.
- Either the scaling issues get bad enough, or the FAANG app gains momentum, or
  building the platform burns enough capital, and this ends up with an early
  sale.
- The buyer then throws their ready-made and highly funded technology platform,
  fixes the issue, and rights the ship.

## Cloud

The cloud shows that there's a ravenous market for solutions that make
technology easier, cheaper, and more elastic. Many companies are willing to pay
[large ($332B)](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-21-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021)
amounts to make computing even a small amount easier. (

is easier? )

However, the cloud's not easy, far from it. Many teams now dedicate large
portions of their time to cloud ops. Instead of making the computing burden
easy, the cloud has forcefully subdivided the work and charged more for the
privilege of using their software after renting their hardware. The cloud
remains difficult, but more practical than any alternative.

## Solution

Batteries Included is building a modern technical infrastructure stack and the
infrastructure team to back it up. Every part of the platform will be cared for,
automatically operating and configuring itself on any customer's setup. Each and
every subsystem should be integrated and work well with each other. No need for
hard decisions because our world-class experts have already made those, then
automated and integrated everything. We have built all the integrations together
with the best user interfaces and the best backend systems. All of this can be
offered in an easy-to-use system that hides the complexity of AWS, GKE, or your
own hardware.

With Batteries Included, creating a new database doesn't require learning a new
programming language. Simply access the dashboard, click a button, answer
straightforward prose questions, and you have a database set up with world-class
monitoring and backups. Everything is there because our team delivered better
than any other infrastructure team, all in a single scalable package.

We don't just provide the tools needed today, though. Batteries Included
provides the tools that are needed tomorrow. We have a full suite of everything
needed to get impact from machine learning. From collaborative software for
training production models to deploying and monitoring them, our platform guides
users in leveraging technologies like PyTorch, Kubeflow, Spark, and Argo.

This allows your engineers to focus on building the company's parts that are
unique and allows your data scientists to focus on finding new insights for
models. All of this is possible because the platform has made it easy to use and
share all aspects of the infrastructure, from data storage to networking,
logging, and monitoring. Everything is integrated and operated by the best.
