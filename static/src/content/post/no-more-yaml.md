Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a pivotal component in modern development,
offering the allure of streamlined, efficient workflows. It employs tools like
Helm and Kubernetes, which enable developers to manage and deploy services using
declarative configurations, predominantly written in YAML. This approach allows
for a more structured, readable, and maintainable infrastructure setup. However,
the practical realization of these benefits is often more complex and elusive
than it appears.

# Not Only Syntax

The integration and interaction between numerous systems introduce a level of
complexity that can be daunting. This complexity often overshadows the promised
simplicity and efficiency, making the benefits of IaC seem like distant,
unattainable mirages for many developers. The struggle is not only with the
syntax or the tool, but with the inherent complexity and specialized knowledge
required to operate modern distributed infrastructure effectively.

# The Problem
