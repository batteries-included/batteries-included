In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, OpenAI has recently shown
the significance of periodic machine learning model retraining. Whether you're a
supporter or a skeptic, their accelerated pace of releasing new versions
underscores a pivotal shift in the AI landscape: the necessity of continuously
updating machine learning models.

## The Imperative of Timely Data

Timely data gives more revenue and better results with machine learning.
Accurate and up-to-date data is the backbone of making precise predictions. For
instance, consider the stock market. Investors with the most recent information
on market trends, company performance, and global events are better positioned
to make informed decisions. Similarly, in machine learning, models trained on
the latest data can identify and adapt to emerging trends, leading to more
accurate predictions.

In the context of OpenAI, timely retraining allows the model to incorporate new
trends and data, enhancing its understanding beyond static embedding. This
dynamic approach ensures the model remains relevant and effective in its
predictions.

## Business Needs and RLHF

Recent changes in ChatGPT highlight the growing importance of
[Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18438).
But what is RLHF? It's a method where models are trained based on feedback from
humans, ensuring that the AI's output aligns more closely with human
preferences.

OpenAI's modifications to its models indicate a changing understanding of human
preferences. Love it or hate it as businesses evolve and gain new insights into
their model outputs, so too will the RLHF reinforcement model be updated, and
new fine-tuned LLMs will need to be created.

## Operational Challenges and Solutions

The journey continues beyond just updating the models. Companies must be
equipped to track model versions, predict variances, and even roll back to
previous versions if needed. Moreover, in extreme cases, there might be a need
to fine-tune live models. Mastering this operational expertise is no small feat.
It demands the integration of multiple systems and a high degree of automation.

Tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have already discovered this and
built their tools. Those tools are private, deeply integrated into their own
custom platforms and other sophisticated tools, and tailored for their vast
workloads and developer teams. So it will take a lot to catch up, but businesses
will need a modern platform if they donâ€™t want to give up agency and decision
making post to systems they don't control.

## The Future: Batteries Included Platform

Looking ahead, platforms like Batteries Included will be game-changers. By
pooling resources into a top-tier infrastructure, they offer immense power
through user-friendly tools. Imagine the convenience of pre-configured
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
designed for seamless collaboration. From Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and
DevOps to Machine Learning Engineers and Business Owners, everyone can work in
harmony, all thanks to features guarded by a
