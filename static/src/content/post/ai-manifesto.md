  'Batteries Included gives you big-tech-grade AI infrastructure for self-hosted
  models — without the big-tech-sized team. Deploy, scale, and stay secure with
  fully automated, open-source tools that run anywhere you choose.'

### The Future of AI Belongs to You

The AI revolution shouldn’t require you to hand your **data**, your **models**,
and your **competitive advantage** to someone else’s servers. If AI is going to
power your business, you deserve to control it — where it runs, what hardware it
uses, and how it’s secured.

Self-hosting isn’t nostalgia. It’s **agency**:

- The power to adopt cutting-edge open-source AI _faster_ than SaaS platforms
  update
- The freedom to adapt and fine-tune without waiting for a provider’s roadmap to
  align with your needs
- The assurance that your training data, evaluation results, and competitive
  signals stay in your hands — not in a hyperscaler’s

In an era where public APIs can change overnight, and every prompt, response,
and dataset you send could quietly train someone else’s models, **private AI is
the only AI that’s truly yours**.

### Hyperscaler Power, Without Hyperscaler Lock-In

Inside companies like Facebook, AI infrastructure feels effortless: one click,
and you’ve got compute, models, monitoring, scaling, and security in place. That
isn’t magic — it’s a **process-driven, automation-heavy culture**, supported by
dedicated teams that turn an idea into a deployed, revenue-driving model in
days.

That speed and agility is the _real_ “secret sauce.” It’s why LLMs are only a
fraction of big tech’s AI advantage — the rest is iteration velocity.

Batteries Included brings that same capability to your own stack:

- **Automated infrastructure** for deploying and iterating on AI models at
  hyperscaler speed
- **Production-grade reliability** without needing a 200-person platform team
- **Run anywhere** — on-prem, in your cloud, or even on your laptop — with the
  same tooling from dev to prod

### Why This Matters Now

Self-hosting AI is still seen as “the hard way” because:

- It’s technically complex (GPU drivers, orchestration, networking, dependency
  hell)
- It’s brittle (security patches and version upgrades are easy to miss — until
  it’s too late)
- It’s slow (DevOps bottlenecks choke iteration speed)
- It’s risky (building on a third-party API is betting your future on someone
  else’s business plan)

We believe self-hosting should be as easy to consume as a public endpoint —
**without giving up control**.

### Our Approach

- **Everything open source** — no black boxes, no lock-in. If you ever leave,
  the system is yours
- **Identical dev and prod environments** — spin up locally, deploy globally,
  with zero config drift
- **Automation at every stage** — upgrades, scaling, failover, security patches
  — so your team focuses on _models_, not maintenance
- **Your infrastructure, your rules** — no data leaves without your say-so

### The Line We Draw

Public cloud AI services will always tempt you with speed and convenience. But
every shortcut you take now compounds into:

- Higher long-term costs
- Compliance headaches
- Loss of competitive edge

**Self-hosted AI isn’t the hard way — it’s the right way.** And with Batteries
Included, it’s finally the easy way too.
