# Batteries Included — Seed Presentation

A modern Reveal.js deck built with Vite and deployed as a static site.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Build static site to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build

Please be aware that preview doesn't do hot module reload well since reveal.js
is not designed for it.

## Deployed

The final version is deployed here: https://seed.pres.batteriesincl.com/
